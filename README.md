# Fine-Tuned Age Detection Model

## Overview

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained **VGG16** model to perform age detection using the **IMDB-WIKI dataset**. The model extracts features from images and predicts the person's age.

## Dataset

- The dataset is located at `/content/drive/MyDrive/DATASET/IMBD WIKI`.
- The model extracts the birth year and photo year from the filenames to compute the age.

## Installation

To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training the Model

Run the following command to train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

## Model Architecture

- **Pre-trained VGG16 (frozen layers)** for feature extraction.
- **Custom layers** (GlobalAveragePooling, Dense, Dropout) for regression.

## Output

- The trained model is saved as `fine_tuned_age_detection_model.h5`.

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for all necessary libraries.
